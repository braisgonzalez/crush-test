# Project README

- This project includes examples of React component patterns.
- React hooks like useState and useEffect help manage state and side effects.
- Components should be pure functions of props and state for predictable UI.
- Use React.StrictMode during development to catch potential issues early.
- Lazy loading with React.lazy and Suspense can improve performance.
