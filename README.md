Hello

- React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces.
- Hooks like useState and useEffect help manage state and side effects.
- JSX lets you write HTML-like syntax directly in JavaScript.
- The virtual DOM efficiently updates the UI when state changes.
