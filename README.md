# Project README

- This project explores building modern UIs with React components.
- React hooks like useState and useEffect manage state and side effects.
- JSX lets you write expressive UI markup directly in JavaScript.
- Components should be pure and reusable; lift state up when necessary.
- Use React.StrictMode in development to catch potential issues early.
