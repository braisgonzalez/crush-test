# Project

- This project uses React principles for composing UI from components.
- Remember to keep components pure and use hooks like useState and useEffect wisely.
- Prefer function components and leverage React.lazy for code-splitting.
- Co-locate component tests and use React Testing Library for user-focused tests.
- Consider memoization with React.memo and useCallback to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
