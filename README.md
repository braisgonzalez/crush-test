Hello

React notes
- React is a library for building user interfaces
- Components can be function or class based, but modern React favors function components with hooks
- The virtual DOM enables efficient UI updates
- Props are read-only; state is managed with useState and other hooks
- Lifting state up helps share data between components
- useEffect runs side effects; clean up subscriptions to avoid leaks
- Keys help React identify list items for reconciliation
- Context provides a way to pass data without prop drilling
