Hello

- React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI.
- Components can be functional or class-based, but hooks encourage functional components.
- Props are read-only; state changes should be handled with setState/useState.
- Keys help React identify which items have changed in lists.
- Effects run after render; cleanup prevents memory leaks in subscriptions.
